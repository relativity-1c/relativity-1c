# Background
This project implements bias and sentiment analysis techniques on large language models, with a specific focus on legal documents and terminologies related to social justice. By analyzing these texts through advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods, we aim to uncover latent biases, sentiment trends, and linguistic patterns that may impact justice and representation within legal frameworks.

Our work leverages machine learning models to interpret and assess legal language in ways that align with principles of fairness and equity. This approach helps in identifying biases that could influence judgments, policy-making, and legal discourse, paving the way for more balanced and inclusive legal narratives
